# MIS-506_Text_Analytics
Assignments from Text Analytics

Using R-Markdown and numerous libraries written for Text Analytics, we analyzed Amazon reviews, Prince lyrics, AirBNB comments, Jane Austen's "Pride and Predjudice", and other publicly available documents. After breaking them up into words, removing common and undesirable words, and cleaning up the data, we would analyze them using whatever new tool we were learning about that week. Not only did we look at word count, but we also looked at the sentiment or feeling that a particular text was generating. We examined word groupings (n-grams), dealing with negating words (How do you deal with "pretty ugly"?), topic modeling with Gamma and Beta matrices, clustering, and correlation tables. 

All of the files in this repository are R-Markdown files in MS-Word format.
